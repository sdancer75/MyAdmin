# MyAdmin
It's an ASP application to view and edit data in any database you can reach via ADO from your IIS.

I used a lot this app as a backoffice to dynamically update the public site of my websites that are created in plain ASP (Active Server Pages) and MSSQL or Access databases. That it was before WordPress, Joomla and other CMS platforms. It is given as opensource.

Much of this code is based in the "Universal Table Editor" created originally by Tom Wellige.

Enjoy.
